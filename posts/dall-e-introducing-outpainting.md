Today we’re introducing Outpainting, **a new feature** which helps users extend their creativity by continuing an image beyond its original borders—adding visual elements in the same style, or taking a story in new directions—simply by using a natural language description.

```js
  const basics = 'Okay, that should we do actually';

  function printBasics() {
    console.log(basics);
  }

  printBasics();
  ```
